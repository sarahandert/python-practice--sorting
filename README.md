# python-practice--sorting

Code written by me for lab assignments with directions provided on input and expected outputs. 

Samples 0 and 1: demonstrate sorting verification for inputs: list of numbers and from a file, including asymptotic running time/ big Oh analysis.

Samples 2 and 3: merge sort and selection sort 
Sample 4: includes a function to generate random numbers to test
Sample 5: Analysis of runtime for sort programs (merge sort and selection sort) that use a list of randomly generated numbers as input from a file, sort them in ascending order, and write the sorted list to the output file.
