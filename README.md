# python-practice--sorting

Code written by me for lab assignments with directions provided on input and expected outputs. 

Samples 0 and 1 demonstrate sorting verification for inputs: list of numbers and from a file, including asymptotic running time/ big Oh analysis.

Samples 2 and 3 merge sort and selection sort, with sample 4 including a function to generate random numbers to test
